This video teaches about sprite shape scripting made by unity. The video's game is more complex and has better animation
then my code the only thing I learnt from the video is how to use the GetPosition, SetPosition, how to edit the tangent
so I only used the video as reference and did not copy a single code from this

This creator shows people how to do a procedural generated 2D terrain procedural generation. The video made us of 
tile maps and uses Perlin nose for generation. The end result of this showcase is a pixal art style map. I only
made use of how he utalized the mathf.PerlinNoise function in his creation. I did not copy any code from this 
creator

I came across this site when searching for free sprite. I originally wanted to make the sprite by myself but due to
Time constraints I decided against it and imported some car and ground sprites.

This video teaches how to create a basic stemina system. I was able to learn how to use use canves and image
how to edit the component and make it fillable object. The original code make a refillable stamina system and 
a most complex animation. My code only make use of a imported sprite made it a fillable object and did a simple
consumtion function

The video showed how to make a 2D car movement script. The creator used a more complex method for their car movement
but I decided against employing it. The only thing I learnt from it is when I had the bug of my car wheel spinning off
I leanrt from this creator that applying the Wheel Join 2D to the car body instead of the wheels makes the car movement
more stable.

This is a Unity Forum for sprite shape scripting. Some of the work shown how to manually manipulate the sprite shape
I used the method to made a starting platform for my project, this platform is constant without the use of perlin noise
generation
